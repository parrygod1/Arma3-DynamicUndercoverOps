## Dynamic Undercover Ops
This mission combines Dynamic Recon Ops and Icontinentia's undercover / civilian recruitment simulation to create a dynamic undercover scenario. There are a few changes to the rule set of the mission to maintain immersion. For the full ruleset on how undercover works, visit https://github.com/1ncontinentia/Incon-Undercover.


## Differences to DRO & Undercover
- There is a new settings tab "Additional settings" for mission setup, make sure to check it out
- To be undercover you must use an uniform from the enemy faction(s) or from the civilian faction you selected.
- Some objectives (arty, cache, mortar, hvt, pow, fortify) have security areas in which you need to be wearing enemy uniforms to not get compromised. You will be notified when you enter one.
- Emplacements, bunkers, compounds are considered security areas. You need an enemy uniform to enter them
- Travelling prisoners won't join your squad unless your disguise is compromised
- Completing objectives will increase players' ratings in order to increase the chance of recruiting civilians
- Stealth is dependent on the disguise compromised status
- Civilian cars are added to starting vehicles list
- Hostile civilians won't attack undercover units
- If you respawn in multiplayer, you are most likely still compromised
- Prisoners that join your squad won't be undercover.

## Compatibility
Requires CBA. Should work with anything else. Works with C2 too, despite the warning.

Will I port this mission to map X? Probably not, however you are more than welcome to do that.
